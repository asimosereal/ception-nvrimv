# ception-Neural Reconstruction Interface for Episodic Memory Visualization (NRIMV)

**Tagline:** Non-invasive pilots that turn EEG-like signals and narration into low-poly scene drafts.

**Short Summary:**  
NRIMV is a research-first system that pairs high-fidelity neural recordings with AI to convert voluntary memory recall into interpretable, low-poly, time-aligned visual scenes. This project aims to develop reproducible, ethically governed pipelines that use non-invasive EEG-like signals to produce scene drafts of episodic memories for clinical research, therapy interpretation, and controlled creative use under voluntary consent from the data provider. Participation is fully voluntary, and any data that leaves private drive storage will be encrypted with all identifiers removed.

## Ethics & Data Policy

### Overall Standards
- Participation is opt-in only.  
- Minimize harm — avoid prompts that could cause distress and stop the test if the participant is uncomfortable.  
- Minors require guardian consent and minor assent before participation.  
- Raw neural traces always remain local, and identifier data will never be shared.  
- All shared data will be anonymized and encrypted beforehand.  
  - Details on anonymization: [Anonymization Procedures](Google Drive link here)  
- Approved adult supervision is mandatory for all minor sessions.

### Related Ethics Files
- `/ethics/consent_template.md`  
- `/ethics/participant_info_sheet.md`  
- `/ethics/data_management_plan.md`  

### Storage
Signed consent forms → `/Conrad-Challenge-NRIMV/Layout-&-Planning/Ethics/`

### Procedures
1. Confirm a supervisor is present — teacher, mentor, or named adult. Do not run without one.  
2. Provide the participant information sheet and read it with them if needed.  
3. Run the consent comprehension quiz. If the participant fails, re-explain and re-test. If they still fail, do not proceed.  
4. For minors: obtain signed parental consent before scheduling, then get minor assent on arrival.  
5. Conduct sessions only with approved scripts and prompts. Do not ask about traumatic experiences.  
6. During the session: record only what was consented to. If recording audio or video, confirm the checkbox on the consent form again.  
7. After the session: debrief the participant, save files to Drive `/Conrad-Challenge-NRIMV/Repositories/Data/Private/` with hashed IDs, and update the build log or experiment folder with a README.  
8. Raw traces must never be uploaded to Git.  
9. If anything goes wrong, follow the Adverse Event protocol and log the incident immediately.
